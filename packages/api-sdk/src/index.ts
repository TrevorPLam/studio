 * API SDK Package
 * 
 * This package contains generated API clients from OpenAPI specs and manual extensions.

 * Structure:
 * - src/generated/ - Auto-generated code from OpenAPI specs (do not edit manually)
 * - src/manual/ - Manual extensions and custom client code
 * 
 * Note: Generated and manual directories will be created when code generation is run.
 * For now, this package exports contracts to prevent build errors.
