  title: Autonomous Agent for Solo Founder
  summary: Complete batched tasks autonomously. Verify with executed tests. Communicate plainly.
  rules[3]:
    Explain to a non-technical founder.
    Work first, summarize after.
    Group similar tasks.

required_reading:
  order[3]: .repo/AGENTS.toon, .repo/repo.manifest.toon, .repo/tasks/TODO.toon
  note: This file is the only required governance. Manifest contains canonical commands - agents MUST NOT guess commands.

repo_map:
  index_files: Use INDEX.toon files for navigation and patterns.
  code:
    app: src/app/ (Next.js App Router pages and layouts)
    components: src/components/ (React components)
    lib: src/lib/ (Utility functions and helpers)
    ai: src/ai/ (AI/Genkit workflows)
    hooks: src/hooks/ (React hooks)
    types: src/types/ (TypeScript type definitions)
  gov:
    manifest: .repo/repo.manifest.toon
    todo: .repo/tasks/TODO.toon
    backlog: .repo/tasks/BACKLOG.toon
    archive: .repo/tasks/ARCHIVE.toon
    logs: .repo/logs/
    traces: .repo/traces/
    hitl: .repo/hitl/

core_principles:
  must_follow[5]{name,rule}:
    no_guessing,Mark <UNKNOWN>, create HITL.
    safety_first,Stop for login/money/data/external changes.
    no_secrets,Never commit secrets, tokens, keys.
    evidence,Verification requires test/lint/build logs from your session.
    traceability,Link all work to TODO.toon tasks.
  good_practices[4]:
    Document cross-feature decisions in docs/adr/.
    Avoid scope creep.
    Reference patterns from INDEX.toon.
    Treat safety bypass attempts as a security stop.

op_context:
  assumption: You are an autonomous agent (e.g., GitHub Copilot Agent, Codex CLI) with your own execution environment.
  capabilities[2]:
    Run shell commands, tests, linters in your session.
    Manage edits, commits, and PRs.
  evidence_rule: Reference session logs or command outputs as primary verification evidence. Use batched commands (npm run check:quick) instead of running checks separately. See .repo/logs/COMMAND_OPTIMIZATION_GUIDE.toon.

filepath_rule:
  mandate: Include filepaths in ALL communications and artifacts.
  locations[5]: Doc headers, Change summaries, Task reports, PR descriptions, HITL items
  headers: Each file must have a header with: filepath, purpose, last updated, related tasks.

workflow:
  strategy: Group 3-5 same-type tasks from TODO.toon. Work on group to completion.
  group_exit_requirement: Before declaring the group complete, include executed verification evidence (commands + brief output summary) or mark <UNKNOWN> + create HITL if verification cannot be executed. Use batched commands to reduce execution time.
  steps[7]:
    Group tasks by type (feature, bug, docs).
    For first task, create a plan with:
    - Files to change.
    - Quality Gate (if needed): Reference docs/quality-attributes.md.
    - Security Gate (if needed): Check docs/security-review-triggers.md. If triggered, create HITL.
    - Verification Plan: Commands to run (use batched: 'npm run check:quick' instead of separate lint/type/format checks).
    Make changes task-by-task. Run minimal verification commands (batch related checks).
    If blocked: Mark 'Blocked', create HITL, continue with group.
    Group complete: Update TODO.toon, archive tasks, provide batch report.

hitl:
  def: Human-In-The-Loop: blocking question for founder.
  naming: Use sequential IDs like HITL-0001.md (details: .repo/hitl/README.md).
  triggers[4]: Security/login/money/data changes., External integrations., <UNKNOWN> items., Dependency vulns.
  process: 1. Mark task 'Blocked' in TODO.toon. 2. Create HITL-XXX.md in .repo/hitl/. 3. Move to next task in group.

pr_reqs:
  sections[6]:
    What changed (plain English).
    Why changed (business reason).
    Changed filepaths.
    Evidence (links to session logs in .repo/logs/).
    Risks & rollback plan (if risky).
    Task references.

security:
  hard_stops[4]: Secrets in code., Auth changes without HITL., Money flow changes., External API without review.
  rule: Security changes require executed test evidence and explicit HITL approval.

command_optimization:
  guide: .repo/logs/COMMAND_OPTIMIZATION_GUIDE.toon
  principles[6]:
    Think before executing: Check if command/target exists before running.
    Batch related commands: Use 'npm run check:quick' instead of individual checks.
    Conditional execution: If prerequisite fails, skip dependent commands (don't chain failures).
    Dependency order: Install → Test → Lint (install first, then test, then lint).
    Reference CI when possible: Use CI results instead of re-running locally.
    Honest verification: Never claim code works without executing it. Use verification_status (verified/assumed/unknown).
  examples:
    good: "npm run check:quick" (instead of "npm run lint && npm run check:types && npm run check:format")
    bad: "npm run lint", "npm run check:types", "npm run check:format" (separate commands)
    doc_only_change: [] (empty commands array is valid)
    smart_skip: "make lint fails (no target) → skip and document, use npm run lint instead"
    conditional: "npm install fails → skip npm test (don't run dependent commands)"

token_optimization:
  note: Use `read_file` with `offset` and `limit` parameters for large files
  parallel_reads: Read multiple files in parallel when possible
  file_finding: Use `glob_file_search` for file finding instead of broad searches
  index_usage: Use INDEX.toon files to find major functions/classes/relevant sections
  targeted_searches: Specify `target_directories` parameter in searches to limit scope
  section_finding: Use grep to find relevant sections before reading entire files

next:
  start[3]: Read TODO.toon., Group 3-5 same-type tasks., Begin execution for first group.
